1. Run the `create_database.py` script to create your sqlite database and table. You only need to call this once.
2. Edit `main.py` to replace `{your_instance_url}` in the `url` with the domain of your instance, then run it to fetch the instances list
3. Run `DB_to_CSV.py` to export your database as a csv file
